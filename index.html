                    Technologies for visual communication are arising, with potential to be 
                    wide-spread in society. Such technologies include augmented reality, virtual reality and 3D interactive websites. All of these technologies work around a three-dimensional framework and as such are far removed from traditional practices of graphic design which consist of flat, print graphics.
