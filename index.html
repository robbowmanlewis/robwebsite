                Chronicle 03 has encopassed exploration has involved adapting and re-thinking structural principles within spatial design, graphic design, and the capabilities of virtual reality technology. Typographic systems have been explored and refined, in an iterative process, to establish a subjective best practice. Investigations and explorations include typeface use, tracking,  line-height, extrusion, the infinite grid, the human scale, typographic grid systems, way-showing, paths, landmarks, and spaces.

                Virtual reality is a technology which is increasing in popularity within a commercial market. Development of design processes for this new technology will allow it to be more fully realised. Currently, content in virtual reality largely mimics that with which it has evolved from, as seen in game design and user interface design. While features have been re-considered for virtual reality, the approach to design remains largely the same. How then can the design process be re-interpreted with new methods of creation, to explore unknown capabilities of this technology.

                    Technologies for visual communication are arising, with potential to be 
                    wide-spread in society. Such technologies include augmented reality, virtual reality and 3D interactive websites. All of these technologies work around a three-dimensional framework and as such are far removed from traditional practices of graphic design which consist of flat, print graphics.
