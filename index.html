                    Technologies for visual communication are arising, with potential to be 
                    wide-spread in society. Such technologies include augmented reality, virtual reality and 3D interactive websites. All of these technologies work around a three-dimensional framework and as such are far removed from traditional practices of graphic design which consist of flat, print graphics.

                    Each experimentation confronts an issue and demonstrates how design practices can solve problems and the impacts of designing with new technologies.
