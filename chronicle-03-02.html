    	Three-dimensional fundamentals
        <br>
        Graphic design experiences a continual process of evolution, due to influence from new technologies. Fundamentals of graphic design have been implemented within previous technological advancements to establish effective communication. As virtual reality has similar application as graphic design, translating these two-dimensional design fundamentals to a three-dimensional environment could produce this effective communication of written information while maintaining immersive qualities. Resulting from this combination of methods could be revolutionary experiences, advancing the way we interact with outputs of visual communication.
        <br>
        Three-dimensional fundamentals in the following chapters explore this translation, and subjectively suggests systems of how these fundamentals function. Such fundamentals are based on the contextual review findings, and are refined through exploration and experimentation.
        <br>
        Fundamentals include typographic treatment, grid systems, and navigation. Chapters following discuss design tools, the application of these fundamentals, and further exploration that have informed the frameworks of the fundamentals.

                    Chronicle 01 <br>
                    Technologies for visual communication are arising, with potential to be 
                    wide-spread in society. Such technologies include augmented reality, virtual reality and 3D interactive websites. All of these technologies work around a three-dimensional framework and as such are far removed from traditional practices of graphic design which consist of flat, print graphics.

                    On the back of the former, Chronicle 01, 3D design by graphic designers for graphic design practices is an evident possibility. Experimentation within this field/medium is vital for understanding application and context. <br>
                    Each experimentation confronts an issue and demonstrates how design practices can solve problems and the impacts of designing with new technologies.
